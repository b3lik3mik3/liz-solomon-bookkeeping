        <h1>Let’s Talk About Your Books</h1>

        <p style="font-size:1.15rem; line-height:1.8; max-width:800px; margin:2rem auto;">
          I am a retired professional with a strong background in accounting, now building a bookkeeping business to support small businesses, entrepreneurs, and nonprofit 
          organizations. Throughout my career, I developed a deep understanding of financial management, accuracy, and organization—skills that I am excited to bring into this 
          new chapter. I enjoy helping business owners gain clarity and confidence in their finances so they can focus on what they do best. My goal is to provide reliable, 
          personalized bookkeeping services with the same dedication and integrity that defined my accounting career.        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 1.15rem; line-height:1.8; max-width:800px; margin:2rem auto;"> 
          I understand the unique challenges small businesses face when it comes to managing finances. My approach is hands-on and personalized; I take the time to get to know 
          your business and tailor our services to meet your specific needs.       </p>
